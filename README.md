# Linux-X86-LottoUniverse
Hobby code development for Linux in C language - Lotto simulation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulations can answer puzzling questions about playing Eurojackpot. If you play lifetime (3380 rounds) do you get lucky and how lucky? If you play one row per week do you select fixed or random numbers to get best results? Does 1,2,3,4,5 * 6,7 win anything?

Here is a spoiler: winning something is hard, winning big time even harder. If you accept this playing is ok. If you dont play, you cant win.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lottosimu uses random cupoung and random winning numbers.

lottosimufix uses fixed chosen numbers and random winning numbers.

With these you can simulate micro and macro world of playing eurojackpot.

KTEM_lottosimu uses random cupoung and random winning numbers.

KTEM_lottosimufix uses fixed chosen numbers and random winning numbers.

With these you can simulate micro and macro world of playing all or nothing.
